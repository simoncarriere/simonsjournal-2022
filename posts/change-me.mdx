## Basics of Markdown

Markdown is the most popular markup language that can be used to format documents. It can be used to create _websites_,_ebooks_,_email_,_chats in discussions forums_.


## Topics

1. Paragraphs

   MD expects a full line space to show texts in a different line else it joins text in the same line.

2. Text decorations

   MD can write **bold** texts, ~~italiic~~ _italic_ texts

3. Headings
   No of #'s represent the type of heading. Github will automatically add id's to headings, so the text will be automatically linked.
   ## This is h2
   ### This is h3
4. Links

   This is super helpful when posting any code snippet

   const fn = () => alert("some fn");
   ```

   ```css
   .hide {
     display: none;
   }
   ```

   Also can show code difference

   var x = 10;
   - const counter = 0;
   + let counter = 0
   ```
