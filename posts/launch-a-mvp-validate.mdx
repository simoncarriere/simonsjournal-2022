So you have this idea and are convinced it could be the next big app. You’re ready to put your life savings to work and spend the next year coding it. It’s such a good idea that you know users will flock in. You can’t wait to be a millionaire!

Hit the brakes.

Before you code your first line or spend 1000$ for that logo, a friendly reminder that YOU ARE NOT YOUR USER. Yup, in caps. Your preferences and assumptions may not always align with those of your user. You first must put yourself in their shoes and strive to understand their needs, goals, and behaviours in order to create a successful user experience. Your success will be measured by how well your product meets their needs rather than your personal preferences. Now, you may be facing a problem yourself and think you have the right solution for yourself, cool. But, if you want to ensure your solution can be broad enough for the many and turn into a successful business model, keep on reading.

We’ll start by exploring how to race to MVP and not be rash, by adopting and integrating validation in your development cycle**.** Together, we’ll explore and compare two different approaches**.** Each involves conducting research, evaluating and testing ideas, determining whether it meets the needs and expectations of our target users and ultimately deciding if it’s worth investing in. We’ll then compare the two and help you decide which approach is best for your use case.

Let me be clear, I'm not advocating dedicating weeks to doing this (nor should it!) and risking losing your first-mover advantage. Instead, I hope to help you find and integrate the right validation cycle for your journey.

## **Let’s quickly define the frameworks.**

**Human-centered design (HCD)** takes a creative and collaborative approach to problem-solving. HCD starts by defining and understanding our users, their needs, and their constraints, in order to identify their pain points. We then use rapid prototyping techniques, often co-designing with users, to test and apply possible solutions to these pain points. By involving users in the design process, we build empathy and gain a deeper understanding of their needs. This leads to more effective solutions that address real-world problems. Ultimately, the HCD process can help you feel more confident in your solutions because they are based on real user feedback, rather than your assumptions.

TLDR : Define → Ideate → Prototype → Test → Implement

**LEAN product development** focuses on building products faster with less waste by involving users early in our process, continuously testing and validating assumptions, and iterating quickly based on feedback. Creating minimum viable products (MVPs) instead of full-featured products allows you to test specific hypotheses and collect feedback to determine whether to pivot or persevere with an idea. It encourages data-driven decisions and analytics to inform decision-making and prioritization of features and improvements that are most likely to have a significant impact.

TLDR : Feedback → Build → Test → Iterate

**A third notable mention:**

**Building openly** has widely been adopted and popularized by the Twitter indie-hacking community. Building openly allows you to incrementally get feedback on your decisions and “features” by sharing it with your community and audience. This fast feedback loop can quickly identify and address issues but, you can’t assume that your audience is or could translate into your target user. For that reason, adopt this alongside either of the two frameworks above and reek the benefits of building an audience.

TLDR : Share → Feedback → Iterate

## When to choose one framework over the other.

So let's recap. Both frameworks are typically iterative and continuous processes and are not strictly divided into sprints. They mainly differ in how they approach product design and development. HCD places more emphasis on user needs and LEAN product development focuses more emphasis on creating value for the customer.

Okay? So what should I do?

Well, if getting to market fast and efficiently is your priority, start by adopting a LEAN approach. Find and talk with your target users, gain a deep understanding of the problem, and develop a MVP. You still need to have a strong market focus.

If your product is radically different or deals with multiple user archetypes, spending time to truly understand your users and their pain points

If you enjoy understanding people's needs and are skilled at research and design, human-centered design might be a better fit for you. Ultimately, it depends on your interests, skills, and career goals.

Both frameworks are similar in how they approach finding and solving user pain points and quickly validating them but have different ways of getting to the solution. Let’s explore when to choose one over the other depending on the type of product you are building and where you are in your development cycle/product roadmap.

Let’s consider the following :

1. Focus: Human-centered design is focused on understanding and meeting the needs of the user, while Lean product development is focused on creating value for the customer.
2. Methodology: HCD is a design thinking methodology that involves a deep understanding of users through observation and empathy, ideation, prototyping, and testing. Lean product development is a continuous improvement methodology that involves creating a minimum viable product, testing it, and using feedback to iterate and improve the product.
3. Goal: The goal of HCD is to create user-centric solutions that meet the needs and desires of the user. The goal of Lean product development is to create a product that is valuable, feasible, and viable.
4. Metrics: HCD measures success through user satisfaction, engagement, and adoption of the product. Lean product development measures success through metrics such as customer acquisition, retention, and revenue.
