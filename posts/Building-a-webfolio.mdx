### An honest colophon

Launching my portfolio was a remarkably challenging personal endeavour. For years I’ve wanted a space to write, showcase my work, experiment, and maybe, finally, begin my journey as a content creator. But, after multiple attempts over the years, I kept iterating or procrastinating without ever launching. I was facing both comparison paralysis and an overly-ambitious, nonnegotiable feature list I had taxed myself with. This is how I learned the hard way, the most important rule of product development.

### 1. Define objectives & identify who you're building for

Start by identifying your target user and develop them into a persona.

- Who will you be speaking to?
- Why are they on your site?
- What are their objectives?
- What information are they looking for and what action do they need to take?
- What makes them unique?

These answers will help you identify touchpoints and communicate your value proposition. I identified my target user as a tech recruiter who has the objective of vetting candidates for an open position at a startup. I could assume I would have merely a 30-seconds window to make an impression, check their boxes and differentiate myself from the hundreds of other prospects. My persona also has an acute sensibility to using digital interfaces and would be able to identify effective UX. These observations are what dictated and help prioritize my MVP into the following requirements:

- A thoughtful and recognizable design system *to communicate my design sensibility and ensure a shared design language across all my projects. This would help convey my unique selling point (USP) as a developer who designs and understands product.*
- A value-creating content strategy to *showcase my interests in new technologies and my ability to condense ideas and learnings for others.*
- A unique and purposeful UI element to serve as a focal point.
- Seamless communication, scheduling and access to all my links.

We can also extend these requirements by modelling an ideal user journey in order to help craft the narrative. In my scenario, a recruiter lands on my page and components individually ease in, a tooltip appears on the search bar guiding them into exploring the focal point. There they find both products I'm currently working on and are exposed to my content strategy where hopefully they find value. By guiding the first 30 seconds, I should be able to check a few of their boxes; technically competent, able to build products and can communicate technical concepts.

### 2. Design

Start by developing a minimal design guide (Read: *How to build a recognizable design system from Figma to Storybook)*. The process will help you define your voice, provide consistency across your creations and showcase a bit of personality. It can be helpful to maintain a system to file inspiration; a method of saving unique UI elements, colour palettes, and type systems you find while browsing. Aggregate these into a mood board, narrow and extract them down to an atomic level and start to craft an identity that reflects you and how you wish to be perceived.

Spend time learning how to use Figma. There are currently no better tools to quickly prototype or visualize your ideas. Every hour spent wireframing translates into five hours you don't spend coding (or something like that). Use the community section to find a free design system and tweak the atoms to match the identity you started creating. It's okay to iterate but don't turn in circles. Remember, race to your MVP.

I found inspiration in Dann Petty's homepage layout and content aggregation, in Open AI's scientifically inspired branding and in Kirchberg's use of animation and stacked hierarchy. I love two-toned, washed-out colour palettes and slick non-serifs fonts with a little personality. I also knew I wanted to keep a minimal aesthetic and design a command palette to be my focal point.

### 3. Development

Choose a stack you're already comfortable with. Don't use your web folio as a test subject to explore a new stack or upgrade to the newest framework update. Instead, execute using the framework you've already learnt, and use the database you already know. Once you've launched then you can start experimenting and extending. Instead of building my search using Algolia and risking getting stuck and frustrated with the implementation, my MVP kept it simple using React hooks. I also resorted to tailwind animation classes and incrementally implemented Framer Motion for more sophisticated animation. Also, spend time translating your design system into individual components before styling your layout. Tailwind makes this super easy by configuring the tailwind.config file with your atoms and the @layer components directive in your CSS to design your molecules.

Finally, here's simonsjournal.com's current colophon:

- Next 12 (Waiting on dependencies to upgrade to V14)
- Content layer
- MDX
- Tailwind
- Framer
- Algolia
- Next Auth / Magic - Authenticating users with Twitter
- Superbase - Track page views & persist individual article discussions
- Gumroad
- Cal.com

### Roadmap & Changelog

My web portfolio will continue to be somewhere to showcase what I'm learning, experimenting with and communicate

I'm proud of myself, its a milestone and the start of my new mantra "Launch it already"

Roadmap for [simonsjournal.com](http://simonsjournal.com/) :

- [x] Clean up the SEO, meta tags, and social images
- [ ] Further, enhance component lifecycle animations.
- [ ] Extend my Cmd Pallette with actions. I’m experimenting with sending emails within the palette through a Q&A and booking appointments (using the google Calendar API). Then do all this with your voice.
- [ ] Add a discussion section to
- [ ] Build a recommendation with graph theory.
